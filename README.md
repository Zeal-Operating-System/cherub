# cherub
Game Boy emulator for TempleOS

This is a work in progress. I know a lot of things are broken. P-please be gentle...

Z80 Core and timing routines ported from [PHP Terminal GameBoy Emulator](https://github.com/gabrielrcouto/php-terminal-gameboy-emulator), which in turn is based on [GameBoy JS Emulator](https://github.com/taisel/GameBoy-Online)
